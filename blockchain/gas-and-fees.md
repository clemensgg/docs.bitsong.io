# Gas and Fees

On BitSong mainnet, the accepted denom is `ubtsg`, where `1btsg = 1.000.000ubtsg`

Transactions on the BitSong network need to include a transaction fee in order to be processed. This fee pays for the gas required to run the transaction. The formula is the following:

$$
fees = ceil(gas * gasPrices)
$$

The `gas` is dependent on the transaction. Different transaction require different amount of `gas`. The `gas` amount for a transaction is calculated as it is being processed, but there is a way to estimate it beforehand by using the `auto` value for the `gas` flag. Of course, this only gives an estimate. You can adjust this estimate with the flag `--gas-adjustment` (default `1.0`) if you want to be sure you provide enough `gas` for the transaction.

The `gasPrice` is the price of each unit of `gas`. Each validator sets a `min-gas-price` value, and will only include transactions that have a `gasPrice` greater than their `min-gas-price`.

The transaction `fees` are the product of `gas` and `gasPrice`. As a user, you have to input 2 out of 3. The higher the `gasPrice`/`fees`, the higher the chance that your transaction will get included in a block.

For mainnet, the recommended `gas-prices` is `0.0025ubtsg`.

### Set `minimum-gas-prices` <a href="#set-minimum-gas-prices" id="set-minimum-gas-prices"></a>

Your full-node keeps unconfirmed transactions in its mempool. In order to protect it from spam, it is better to set a `minimum-gas-prices` that the transaction must meet in order to be accepted in your node's mempool. This parameter can be set in the following file `~/.bitsongd/config/app.toml`.

The initial recommended `min-gas-prices` is `0.0025ubtsg`, but you might want to change it later.
